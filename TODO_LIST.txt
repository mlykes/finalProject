1) Create GitHub Porj. (Done)
2) Create a webpage that has textboxes to input current location and best time to meet.
3) after the user click submit then it takes the user to another page where it shows the best location & time to meet.
4) let's write the data that the user inputs so we can say that we are using little db and nodejs.
5) data sturcture should look like this :
	{Name: "Omar", Latitude: "111", Long: "222", preferredTime: "15:00"}
6) we could probably come up with an argument saying that we are going to use this data for ML stuff and might give us the chance to exapnd.

Idea:
1) in the navigation tab there is create a group option where it takes usernames as inputs.
2) each group has a name and members and each member has a current location.
3) each member has 3 fav resturants.
4) in each group you come up with an alogrithm that gives each resturant a wieghted score.
5) find the central location.
6) search for resturant1 in that area if it is not there go to resturant2 ...etc.
